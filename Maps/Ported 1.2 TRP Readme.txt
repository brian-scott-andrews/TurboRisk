Ported 14 Readme

Hey Guys,

Finally got them all ported. I want to thank Mario for creating this. The individual authors of these TRP's, for creating them. Nathan Scarbrough for porting many others, I was able to use Notepad++ to compare digger that comes with 2.0.5 (ported by nathan)  to other trp's also created by Martin Nehrdich. Many of the changes were copied wholesale and a few others required individual variable mods (randy12). I also want to thank Chiel for his help in getting this all started and crucial tips on doubles.

Some notes. 

defender14 doesn't seem to win a ton (duh). 
constant14 does not compile.
randy12 will occasionally try to reinforce to territory 0 and lock the game. He is also terrible. 
slave14 does not announce who they are a slave to. Can cause the game to lock. 
hunter14 does not announce who their goal is. He wins more than digger. 
walker2_14 wins enough to be interesting.
Pitbull14 does not compile
Piranha14 I have yet to see when a game but adds a level of randomness to who will end up winning.
Latest digger TRP included for reference.

I would love to see the last two I couldn't get to compile fleshed out. I can also upload the originals if needed for comparison.

Note that while two of them can lock the game, so can Descartes and Tectonic, so if you enjoy those players don't be afraid to try these out.
