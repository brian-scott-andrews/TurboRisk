<h1>TurboRisk Conversion Reference</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Since its birth and up to version 1.2, the scripting facility of TurboRisk was
based on the free Delphi Interpreter by S.Kurinny & S.Kostinsky (Delphin). From
version 2.0 on, TurboRisk uses the Delphi-style
<a href="http://www.remobjects.com/ps.aspx" target="_blank">RemObjects Pascal Script</a>
(ROPS) runtime interpreter .
<p>
This documents explains some of the differences between the two script
languages and their implementation in TurboRisk, and deals with some of the
issues to face when converting a TRP from the older version to the current one.

<hr>

<h2>General program structure</h2>

<p>

The typical program structure of a TRP expected by the current version of
TurboRisk is described in the document
<a href="programs.html">programs.html.</a>
There are few differences between this structure and the previous one.

<ol>
	<li>
	Until TurboRisk 1.2, the five procedure
	<I>Assignment, Placement, Attack,	Occupation</I> and <I>Fortification</I>
	were at any effect independent programs. For this
	reason you were not allowed to write common functions or procedures to share
	among all of the them. Anything that was before the declaration of those
	procedures or after their last <I>end;</I>
	statement was treated as a comment. This is no more true: the source file is at
	any effect a unique and complete Pascal program.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	One of the effects of point 1 is that free text between the procedures is no
	more allowed, you have to make sure it respects the standard Pascal conventions
	for comments.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	Another effect of point 1 is that now you can define your own functions or
	procedures, and that you can call them from any other procedure. Actually you
	have to do so, because ROPS doesn't implement the definition of procedures and
	functions inside another procedure or function. Some of the old TRPs use this
	nested structure: the inner procs and funcs have to be moved outside.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	The source may begin with an optional
	<code>
		<B>Program</B>	<I>MyProgram;</I>
	</code>
	statement. It is allowed for clarity, but has no effect.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	TurboRisk 1.2 used three implicit global variables to send parameters to the
	routines and receive their results:
	<I>FromTerritory, ToTerritories</I> and <I>Armies.</I>
	These variables don't exist anymore. Values are passed and received by
	TurboRisk using parameters:
	<p>
	<code>
		<B>procedure</B> Assignment(var ToTerritory: integer);
		<br>
		<B>procedure</B> Placement(var ToTerritory: integer);
		<br>
		<B>procedure</B> Attack(var FromTerritory, ToTerritory: integer);
		<br>
		<B>procedure</B> Occupation(FromTerritory, ToTerritory: integer; var Armies: integer);
		<br>
		<B>procedure</B> Fortification(var FromTerritory, ToTerritory, Armies: integer);
		<br>
	</code>
	<p>
	For those of you not very familiar with Pascal, the word <B>var</B>
	before the declaration of a parameter means that this is passed "by reference"
	instead of "by value". That is, if the procedure modifies its value, the calling
	program receives the modified value.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	The program MUST contain a main flow, delimited by the
	<B>begin</B> and <B>end.</B> words. 
	As in any good old Pascal Program, this main flow has to be placed at
	the very end of the source, so that	<B>end.</B>
	is the last statement in the source. This structure is required by ROPS, but
	TurboRisk doesn't need it, so you can leave the
	<B>begin</B> and <B>end.</B>
	block empty. However, if you place any instruction there, that code will be
	executed once at the beginning of a new game. This can be useful to prepare
	some configuration and store it in the buffers.
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>
	ROPS performs much more strict controls about structure than Delphin does. For
	this reason, some of the old TRPs, which have non matching begin-end pairs,
	don't compile anymore.
</ol>

<h2>Types, Variables, Expressions</h2>

<p>
As in TurboRisk 1.2, all the variables you define will be LOCAL variables, no
matter their scope. This happens because TurboRisk uses the same space to load
and execute all of the different computer player programs,
turn after turn. You still have to store GLOBAL values using the TurboRisk
internal buffers, which you can have access to through the UBufferSet and
UBufferGet functions.
<p>
The possibility of defining global scope variables is still a new useful
feature, which makes possible for a procedure to share values with other called
procedures.
<p>
The <B>real</B> type is no more supported. Use <B>double</B> instead.
<p>
ROPS uses standard PASCAL conventions about the syntax and priorities of
operators, including the logical one. The following statement was legal in
TurboRisk 1.2:
<p>
<code>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if TIsMine(x) and TArmies(x)=TArmies(x) then begin
	<br>
</code>
<p>
but it's no more legal in current TurboRisk. In PASCAL the <B>and</B>
operator has a higher priority than the "equal", "greater than", "less then"
and the other comparation operators, so the proper syntax for that statement
shall be:
<p>
<code>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if TIsMine(x) and <B>(</B>TArmies(x)=TArmies(x)<B>)</B>	then begin
	<br>
</code>

<p>
ROPS is not very tolerant about <B>type mixing</B> in expression and logical
conditions. The following code aborts execution, because it compares an integer value with
a double value:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;TotalArmies: integer;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if PArmiesCount(T)&gt;TotalArmies * 0.35 then
</code>
<P>
The correct code fragment is the following:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;TotalArmies: integer;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if PArmiesCount(T)&gt;trunc(TotalArmies * 0.35) then
</code>

<p>
You need to be careful when using this method though. Consider the following example:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b> 
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;TotalArmies: integer;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if PArmiesCount(T)&lt;trunc(TotalArmies * 0.35) then
</code>

<p>
Notice that the comparative operator has changed.  If PArmiesCount(T) is 17 and
TotalArmies * 0.35 is 17.5, then 17.5 will be truncated to 17 and the statement
will be false even though it should be true.
<br>
You can use type casting in this case to get the correct result:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b> 
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;TotalArmies: integer;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if double(PArmiesCount(T))&lt;TotalArmies * 0.35 then
</code>

<p>
There are some other reported issues about ROPS and type mixing in logical
expressions. For example the code:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;i: integer;
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;d: double;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;...
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if (TArmies(T) / i) &lt; d then ...
</code>
<p>
stops the interpreter any time TArmies(T)/i is not a whole number. The trunc() function 
won't work in this case, so it is necessary to use type casting instead:
<p>
<code>
	<b>var</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;i: integer;
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;d: double;
	<br>
	<b>begin</b>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;...
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;if (double(TArmies(T))) / (double(i)) &lt; d then ...
	</code>

<h2>TurboRisk API</h2>

<p>
Some of the interface functions have a new syntax:

<p>
<code class=api>
	procedure UMessage(M: string);
</code>
<br>
Previously it accepted an unlimited number of parameters, of any kind:
<br>
<code class=api>
	UMessage('Error: ',MyIntVar+4,... );
</code>
<br>
Now you have to pass a single string value. Thus the previous example becomes:
<br>
<code class=api>
	UMessage('Error: '+IntToStr(MyIntVar+4)+... );
</code>
<br>

<p>
<code class=api>
	procedure ULog(M: string);
</code>
<br>
Same as UMessage.

<p>
<code class=api>
	procedure UBufferSet(B: integer; V: double);
	<br>
	function UBufferGet(B: integer): double;
</code>
Previously the value stored in the buffer was of type variant. Now it is a
double.

<p>
<code class=api>
	function URandom(R: integer): double;
</code>
<br>
This function as well returns a double;

<h2>TRComp</h2>

TRComp is a TurboRisk program Compiler. It allows simple editing of your source
file and provide an interface to the ROPS engine. Take advantage of it to
compile your TRP and detects any problem it might have in the structure or in
the syntax.
