TurboRisk History
=================

Known bugs in the current release
---------------------------------

- There is a memory deallocation bug still not resolved. This cause the program to allocate more and more memory every time you start a new game. This bug is probably located inside the interpreter and not in TurboRisk itself. I will work at it.
Workaround: close and re-open TurboRisk after a few games.

- It has been reported the the FORTIFICATION routine is not always called. I coudln't reproduce this problem but I'll keep on checking.

History
-------

Version 1.2 - August 1999

- Due to a subtle bug TurboRisk stopped calling the ATTACK procedure of a Computer Player after the OCCUPATION routine was called the first time during a turn. Corrected.

- A similar bug happened when a computer opponent defeated a player and got his cards: if it had enough to make a set and get armies, the PLACEMENT procedure was called to place them, but the attack procedure was not called afterwards. Corrected.

- The first time the players dialog box was opened after having ran TR, the "computer file" entry of the first player in the .ini file was changed to simple.trp.

- The log message for the OCCUPATION routine was doubled. Corrected.

- The log messages now say clearly whether the troops movement are due to the OCCUPATION or the FORTIFICATION routine.


Version 1.1 - March 1999

- SPlayersCount() returned always 10 instead of the actual number of active players. Corrected.

- New function PProgram that returns the program file name of computer players.

- New function URandom to generate integer/real random numbers

- Wrong main map scaling for screen resolution other than 800x600 corrected.


Version 1.0 - January 1999

- TurboRisk released.
